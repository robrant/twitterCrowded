* MAJOR ISSUE:
  - The twitter connection client only handles 1 connection from a single machine because (I think) of the 
    port being used. So, if multiple events are running in crowded, only the latest created one will be
    accepting tweets. The other background commandline job will have been terminated.
    
    The only (?) way around this is to terminate the current tweet stream, modify it to include the new
    event (be that geo OR tag) and then continue.
    
    When the tweet comes through the stream though, it needs to be tied to an event, so that it can go into
    the right event:document. This is how to do that:
    
    1. Check the tag - is the tag in the hashtags[]? Make a DISTINCT call to the db on starting the connectionClient
       Return a list of tags and do a lookup against the hashtags for this tweet. If it's in there, add that as an objectId.
       Adding the objectId gets over the issue of having images that match 2 events - they would simply get added to both.

    2. Loop the geo event:documents, and get back the BBox --> into N, E, S, W
       If has coordinates, check lat is between the Lat range. Lon is between the lon range. If so, add the objectId.

	So, when the CRON job checks for new/old.
	If it finds a new:
		1. Kills the old and adds in the new condition
	If it finds an old:
		1. Kills the old connection Client and drops the old entry from it.
		
	PROBABLY WANT TO GO TO THE ALTERNATIVE WAY OF CALLING IT.
	PROBABLY WANT TO WORK OUT HOW TO PUT IN MULTIPLE ENTRIES.
		

* MINOR ISSUES:
  - as an argument to the command line call call, add in a URL for the POST callback. Manage could take this from the config file.
